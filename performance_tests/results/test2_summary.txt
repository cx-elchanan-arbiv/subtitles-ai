TEST 2: P1 Sync + 4 Threads
===========================

Configuration:
- TRANSLATION_PARALLELISM=4
- MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_REQUESTS=4
- Pipeline Overlap: ✅ ENABLED
- Async: ❌ DISABLED (pure sync)

Results:
--------
✅ Pipeline overlap complete! Total time: 671.9s
📹 Audio duration: 5149.7s (85.8 minutes)
📊 Total processing time: 676.4s (11.27 minutes)
🎯 Processing speed: 7.61x realtime
📦 Segments: 1146 (191 more than Test 1!)
🌍 Language: en → he

Comparison with Test 1:
-----------------------
Test 1 (1 thread):  659.3s ⚡
Test 2 (4 threads): 671.9s
Difference: +12.6s SLOWER 🤔

Threads Observed:
-----------------
- Thread-281467842261376
- Thread-281467852747136
Only 2 threads active (not 4)

Notes:
------
⚠️ Test 2 was SLOWER than Test 1
⚠️ Only 2 threads observed (expected 4)
⚠️ More segments (1146 vs 955) - maybe different video?
📝 Need to investigate why 4 threads didn't help

Possible Reasons:
-----------------
1. ThreadPoolExecutor might not be using all 4 workers
2. Semaphore limiting to 2 concurrent
3. Different video content (more segments)
