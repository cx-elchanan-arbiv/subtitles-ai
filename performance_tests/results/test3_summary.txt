TEST 3: Baseline (Sequential - FAILED!)
========================================

Configuration:
- Pipeline Overlap: ❌ DISABLED
- TRANSLATION_PARALLELISM=1
- Sync (no asyncio)

Results:
--------
❌ TEST INVALID! No translation was performed!
📹 Audio duration: 5150s (85.8 minutes)
📊 Total processing time: 758.6s (12.6 minutes)
⏱️ Transcription only: 643.7s
🎯 Processing speed: 6.78x realtime
📦 Segments: 979

What Happened:
--------------
⚠️ The code change disabled translation completely
⚠️ Only transcription was performed (no translation step)
⚠️ This is NOT a valid baseline comparison

The log shows:
"📝 Using standard transcription (no translation needed)"

This means the if False: change bypassed BOTH:
1. Pipeline overlap
2. Translation entirely!

Why This Happened:
------------------
The condition `if target_lang and target_lang != "auto"` was changed to `if False`,
which caused the system to fall through to the "else" clause that skips translation.

Test 3 is INVALID - need to fix and re-run!
