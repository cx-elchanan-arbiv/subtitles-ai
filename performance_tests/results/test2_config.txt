TEST 2: P1 Sync + 4 Threads
===========================

Configuration Changes from Test 1:
----------------------------------
✅ TRANSLATION_PARALLELISM=1 → 4
✅ MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_REQUESTS=1 → 4
✅ Pipeline Overlap: ENABLED (same)
✅ Async: DISABLED (same - pure sync)

Expected Improvements:
---------------------
- 4 batches processing concurrently
- Reduced "tail" time after transcription
- Faster overall processing for long videos
- 4 different thread IDs in logs

What to Look For:
----------------
- inflight=2,3,4 (concurrent batches)
- Multiple Thread-XXXXX IDs
- Faster batch throughput
- Expected: ~600-620s (saving 40-60s from Test 1)

Ready to test!
