TEST 3: Baseline (Sequential - NO Pipeline Overlap)
====================================================

Configuration Changes:
---------------------
❌ Pipeline Overlap: DISABLED
   - Changed: if target_lang... → if False
   - Will use SEQUENTIAL flow: Transcription → Translation

✅ TRANSLATION_PARALLELISM=1
✅ MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_REQUESTS=1
✅ Sync (no asyncio) - same as Test 1 & 2

This is the "BEFORE P1" baseline!
----------------------------------

What's Different from Test 1:
------------------------------
Test 1: ✅ Pipeline overlap (transcribe + translate simultaneously)
Test 3: ❌ NO pipeline overlap (transcribe, THEN translate)

Expected Result:
----------------
Test 3 should be SLOWER than Test 1
- Expected: ~720-750s (60-90s slower than Test 1's 659s)
- Why? Because translation waits for transcription to finish completely
- No parallel processing between transcription and translation

What to Look For:
-----------------
1. Logs should show: "Sequential flow" or "Standard transcription"
2. Translation starts AFTER transcription finishes
3. Two distinct phases:
   - Phase 1: Transcription only
   - Phase 2: Translation only (after transcription done)

Ready to test!
